# Disease spread simulations
The codes pandemia.py, disease_simulation_SIR.py, morte.py, and semanal.py were used to explore different scenarios in which a disease could be spread. Also, they vary by mixing in different rates of death, spreading, and healing in order to understand better about probability and how the scenarios would behave given this change. 
These codes were written for my undergraduate research project which turned out to be a game.
